This is a port of classic flash game CANABALT, which was ported into HaxeFlixel (the descendant of Flixel, which was used in the original game). Now supports various cross platform goodness (HTML5, Windows, Mac, Linux), the Newgrounds API ([via Newgrounds.io](https://newgrounds.io)) for leaderboards, and touch + gamepad support!

You can play the game on:

- [Newgrounds.com](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/510303)
- [Itch.io](https://finji.itch.io/canabalt-classic)
- [Canabalt.com](https://canabalt.com/)

**Fixes and HTML5 release:** adjusted the smoke emitter that caused crashes and reorganized files for publication on GitHub Pages. â€” _Leonardo Dias Gomes (YouTube: @BULOFK, Building a Legacy of Knowledge), 2025_

## Compiling

0. Make sure when you clone, you clone the submodules to get the assets repo:
   - `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/canabalt-hf.git`
   - If you accidentally cloned without the `assets` submodule (aka didn't follow the step above), you can run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to get the assets in a foolproof way.
1. Install Haxe from [Haxe.org](https://haxe.org), using 4.3.3 as of writing!
   - Recommend using [`haxeget`](https://github.com/l0go/haxeget)
2. Install `hmm` (run `haxelib --global install hmm` and then `haxelib --global run hmm setup`)
3. Install haxelibs by running `hmm install`
4. Compile via `lime test PLATFORM`, `mac`, `linux`, `windows`, `html5` and probably even `hl`

## How close to the original source is this ðŸ¤”

The haxe code is as close to the original source code as it could get, with minor tweaks for modern "flixel", crossplatform controls support, and small bug fixes. If you look through the code, what you will look at is very close to what Adam Saltsman wrote for the original Actionscript 3 release of Canabalt, _hopefully_ resulting in 1:1 gameplay.
